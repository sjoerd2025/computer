# Cloudflare Computer

Cloudflare Computer is a virtual filesystem that lives inside a
Durable Object. The Durable Object holds the authoritative state in
SQLite and exposes one pluggable execution surface through
`workspace.runtime`. Three backends ship today:

- **Container** projects the SQLite state into a sandbox container as
  a real FUSE mount. A sandbox-side daemon (`computerd`) mounts the state
  as a filesystem and syncs changes back over a capnweb RPC channel.
  Full Linux userland, real binaries, real network.
- **Isolate shell** runs [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash)
  in a Dynamic Worker. It reaches the authoritative Workspace over
  Workers RPC, so there is no second store or sync round trip.
- **Isolate JavaScript** runs an ECMAScript module in a fresh Dynamic
  Worker with structured input/results, durable relative imports,
  configured libraries, Workspace-backed `node:fs/promises`, and trusted `ws:git` and
  `ws:artifacts` modules.

A Workspace may register multiple backends under stable IDs.
`workspace.runtime.exec(source, { backend })` is the single execution
entry point; the selected backend defines whether `source` is a shell
command or an ECMAScript module. Backends connect lazily on first use.

Workspace can also be constructed without a backend at all, giving
callers the filesystem on its own.

## Requirements

- Node 22 or newer.
- npm. This repo uses npm workspaces.
- Linux with FUSE if you want to run `packages/computerd` end-to-end. Other
  packages build and test on macOS as well.
- Docker, optionally, for [`examples/container`](examples/container).
  The worker example needs no Docker.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/computer.git
cd computer
npm install
npm run build:all
npm test
```

To see the pieces working together, start with the examples:

- [`examples/container`](examples/container) — runs `computerd` inside a
  container, mounts a workspace, and talks to a Durable Object over
  capnweb.
- [`examples/worker`](examples/worker) — same HTTP surface as the
  container example, but the shell runs in a Dynamic Worker loaded
  through `env.LOADER`. No container.
- [`examples/codemode`](examples/codemode) — external `@cloudflare/codemode`
  `Executor` backed by a dedicated Computer JavaScript runtime.
- [`examples/think`](examples/think) — an agent that uses the
  workspace as its working directory.

## Repository layout

The repo is a small monorepo. Each package has its own README with
package-specific status and usage notes.

- [`packages/dofs`](packages/dofs/README.md) (`@cloudflare/dofs`) —
  Durable Object SQLite-backed virtual filesystem, sync protocol
  building blocks, and a `@platformatic/vfs` provider for Node.
- [`packages/rpc`](packages/rpc/README.md)
  (`@cloudflare/computer-rpc`) — capnweb wire types and
  server/client helpers shared between the Durable Object and `computerd`.
- [`packages/computerd`](packages/computerd/README.md)
  (`@cloudflare/computerd`) — the `computerd` daemon: a FUSE mount plus
  HTTP/WebSocket RPC server that runs inside the sandbox container.
- [`packages/computer`](packages/computer/README.md)
  (`@cloudflare/computer`) — the top-level Computer package
  consumed by Durable Objects. Work in progress.

## Performance

Numbers from `script/fs-bench.sh` and a full
`npm install` of [`cloudflare/sandbox-sdk`](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk)
(854 packages, 36,675 files), running
[`examples/container`](examples/container) on a Cloudflare
Containers **standard-2** instance (1 vCPU, 6 GiB memory, 12 GB disk).
The computerd FUSE mount lives at `/workspace`; the comparison columns are
an in-memory `tmpfs` at `/tmp` and the container's ext4 root disk at
`/var/tmp`.

Ratios are `computerd / baseline` — lower is faster, values below 1.0 mean
computerd beats the baseline.

| npm init + tiny install | 598.5 ms | 630.7 ms | **0.95x** | 630.7 ms | **0.95x** |

### Full `cloudflare/sandbox-sdk` `npm install`

| Target | Duration |
|---|---:|
| tmpfs (`/tmp`) | 34.3 s |
| computerd FUSE (`/workspace`) | 124.7 s |
| ext4 disk (`/var/tmp`) | 63.9 s |

computerd is ~2x slower than the container's ext4 disk for the full
`npm install`, and ~3.6x slower than tmpfs. The disk comparison is
the more realistic baseline for general usage.

### Where computerd is faster than the disk baseline

The in-memory inode store beats real disk on metadata-heavy work:
`stat`, `rm`, `mkdir tree`, `find tree`, `git init`, `git clone`,
`npm init`. Those eight scenarios cover most of the day-to-day cost
of tools like `git status`, module resolution, and incremental
builds.

### Where computerd is slower

Large sequential file I/O. The computerd write path hashes each
[`CHUNK_SIZE`](packages/dofs/src/fs/writeFile.ts) (512 KiB) chunk
into a content-addressed blob store on every release; that's how
the Durable Object can sync only the chunks that changed and
deduplicate identical content. The cost lands on raw
`dd`-style throughput numbers but rarely on real developer
workloads, which is why `npm init + tiny install` matches the disk
baseline despite `pure read 64 MiB` being 30x slower.

### Reproducing

```bash
bash script/run-fs-bench.sh
```

or against a deployed `computerd-container` instance, upload
[`script/fs-bench.sh`](script/fs-bench.sh) and run it with
`MOUNT=/workspace BASE=/tmp`.
